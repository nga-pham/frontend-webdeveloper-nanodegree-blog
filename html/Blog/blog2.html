                            <p>At some point during college, a friend asked people to join him at salsa class. I hadn’t
                                known what salsa was, but heck, I’d take it just to have a chance to dance. It turned
                                out
                                salsa was pretty cool, and soon I came to like it. With all bones and no curve, I was
                                neither graceful nor sexy. I stiffened up even worse when I danced with a guy. But for
                                the
                                first time in my life, I was able to move in sync with music and a partner. It was a new
                                feeling. Salsa is a social dance and there is a lot of interaction between leader and
                                follower. It is almost like a conversation: there are prompts and responses. You’ll
                                catch
                                people smiling gleefully at their partners when they are dancing salsa. That’s how the
                                girl
                                says <em>“That move was really cool, thanks for leading us into it,” and how the guy
                                    says
                                    “Wow,
                                    what you just did is really pretty!”</em></p>
                            <p>I was never really good at social dances. There is only so much you could practice on
                                your
                                own. Social dances require connection between partners. As a follower, I had to be able
                                to
                                react and respond instantly and constantly to the leader’s signals. These things only
                                come
                                with experience. I also needed to feel comfortable dancing with partners, and being as
                                insecure as I was, that wasn’t going to happen. In college, I had one partner — my
                                friend,
                                and we only practiced for a couple of showcases. Our audience said it looked like I was
                                leading and cajoling him, instead of the other way around. Oh well.</p>
                            <p>When I went to my first salsa lesson in grad school, it was more comfortable: at least I
                                wasn’t too awkwardly tall among those folks. The instructor asked to “borrow” me to
                                illustrate a dance (note: this happens to anyone randomly and does not imply I was a
                                better
                                dancer). We were about to start when he asked what my name was. He told the class: “Linh
                                has
                                this connection that comes out from her wrist. When you are on a dance floor, having a
                                wrist
                                like this will make everyone want to dance with you.”</p>
                            <p><u>That wasn’t completely true — not everyone wants to dance with me — but it pulled my
                                    self-esteem up quite a bit. I trusted my ability to dance more. I stopped thinking
                                    that
                                    I
                                    just sucked at this and that I should just quit. I might not ever become a wonderful
                                    dancer,
                                    like some of my friends are, but I am capable of becoming better to myself now.
                                    That’s
                                    all
                                    that matters.</u></p>
                            <blockquote>So if you’ve just started dancing, or really anything, and feel like you are
                                such a
                                loser, let me tell you that it’s not true. It is only true if you allow it to be so. The
                                wonderful dancers you see out there used to feel like that, too. They just didn’t give
                                up.
