                    <p class="blog-post-meta">January 2, 2014 by <a href="#">Linh Ngo</a></p>

                    <p>At some point during college, a friend asked people to join him at salsa class. I hadn’t
                        known what salsa was, but heck, I’d take it just to have a chance to dance. It turned
                        out
                        salsa was pretty cool, and soon I came to like it. With all bones and no curve, I was
                        neither graceful nor sexy. I stiffened up even worse when I danced with a guy. But for
                        the
                        first time in my life, I was able to move in sync with music and a partner. It was a new
                        feeling. Salsa is a social dance and there is a lot of interaction between leader and
                        follower. It is almost like a conversation: there are prompts and responses. You’ll
                        catch
                        people smiling gleefully at their partners when they are dancing salsa. That’s how the
                        girl
                        says <em>“That move was really cool, thanks for leading us into it,” and how the guy
                            says
                            “Wow,
                            what you just did is really pretty!”</em></p>
                    <p>I was never really good at social dances. There is only so much you could practice on
                        your
                        own. Social dances require connection between partners. As a follower, I had to be able
                        to
                        react and respond instantly and constantly to the leader’s signals. These things only
                        come
                        with experience. I also needed to feel comfortable dancing with partners, and being as
                        insecure as I was, that wasn’t going to happen. In college, I had one partner — my
                        friend,
                        and we only practiced for a couple of showcases. Our audience said it looked like I was
                        leading and cajoling him, instead of the other way around. Oh well.</p>
                    <p>When I went to my first salsa lesson in grad school, it was more comfortable: at least I
                        wasn’t too awkwardly tall among those folks. The instructor asked to “borrow” me to
                        illustrate a dance (note: this happens to anyone randomly and does not imply I was a
                        better
                        dancer). We were about to start when he asked what my name was. He told the class: “Linh
                        has
                        this connection that comes out from her wrist. When you are on a dance floor, having a
                        wrist
                        like this will make everyone want to dance with you.”</p>
                    <p><u>That wasn’t completely true — not everyone wants to dance with me — but it pulled my
                            self-esteem up quite a bit. I trusted my ability to dance more. I stopped thinking
                            that
                            I
                            just sucked at this and that I should just quit. I might not ever become a wonderful
                            dancer,
                            like some of my friends are, but I am capable of becoming better to myself now.
                            That’s
                            all
                            that matters.</u></p>
                    <blockquote>So if you’ve just started dancing, or really anything, and feel like you are
                        such a loser, let me tell you that it’s not true. It is only true if you allow it to be so. The
                        wonderful dancers you see out there used to feel like that, too. They just didn’t give
                        up.
                    </blockquote>
